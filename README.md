So lots to explain here but I'll try my best 
This website starts you on the home page
from there you can add books or view books

viewing books will list all books in DB
adding books will take you to a form page

if you click on the id number in the book list, it takes you to the book detail page
on the detail page, you can select to edit the book or to delete it 

deleting the book will call a JS function (I could have done it differently but I wanted to add a confirm message . . . 
also make sure you run this in chrome or that confirm message will not show up) to prompt the user to click yes or no 
if yes, the JS function will POST to the server and then redirect the user

that's it!

PS I'm not entirely sure the sizing is correct for all view ports so if it looks a little wonky please lmk and we can view it on my laptop ty <3
